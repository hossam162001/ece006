	Before it leads to artificial intelligence, let's understand what intelligence means -
Intelligence: the ability to learn and solve problems. This definition is taken from the Webster dictionary.

The most common answer one would expect is "to make computers smart so you can act smart!" But the question is, how smart? How can one judge intelligence?

... as smart as humans. If computers are, in one way or another, able to solve real-world problems, by optimizing on their own from past experiences, they will be called "smart."
Hence, AI systems are more general (rather than specific), and have the ability to "think" and be more flexible. Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is information gained through experience. Experience is knowledge gained through exposure (training). To summarize the conditions, we obtain artificial intelligence as a "copy of something natural (i.e. humans)" who "can access the information that I have gained through exposure and applicationIntelligence is composed of:

Reasoning
Learning
Problem Solving
Perception
Linguistic Intelligenc."
